# Uber Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python script utilizes the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze and visualize sample Uber ride data. The script creates a DataFrame, extracts additional features such as day of the week and hour, and explores the most popular days and hours for rides. The results are presented through bar charts for clear visualization.

## Data
The provided sample Uber data includes columns for date, time, pickup and dropoff locations, and distance traveled. Users can replace this placeholder data with their own dataset for customized analysis.

## Key Steps
1. **DataFrame Creation:** The script initializes a DataFrame using the provided sample data.
2. **Data Transformation:** The 'Date' column is converted to a datetime object, and additional features like day of the week and hour are extracted.
3. **Analysis:** The script determines the most popular days and hours for Uber rides, emphasizing Wednesday as having more rides than Monday.
4. **Visualization:** Matplotlib is used to create two bar charts depicting the most popular days and hours.
5. **Presentation:** The layout is adjusted for better visual presentation, and the plots are displayed.

## How to Use
1. Replace the sample Uber data with your own dataset.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas` and `matplotlib`).
3. Run the script in a Python environment.
4. Review the generated bar charts illustrating popular days and hours for Uber rides.

## Note
Feel free to customize the script based on your specific dataset and analysis requirements. Explore additional visualizations or extend the analysis to gain insights into Uber ride patterns.
